  As a company you are a core part to our networking day. You have been scheduled for various speed dates with the students
  attending the event. During the afternoon there will be students from both the first and second years coming to you in groups, you will be speed dating with
  1 or 2 groups at a time. During the evening there will only be third and fourth years, and the speed dates will be more intimate. The speed date
  times are in your schedule below, please ensure you are at your table before the speed date starts, since the students are here to see you!
  </p>
  <p>
  There is also a company market planned in your schedule, this is a time dedicated to letting the students walk around and visit your table,
  this is to allow the students to speak with companies they havent had the chance to meet or to talk more with companies they are interested in.
  During this time please stay at your table to greet any students interested in speaking with you.
  </p>

  If you are a company that is attending in both the afternoon and evening programs, we have dinner for you at 17:30! this will be an italian
  buffet that will take place in the break room. If you have any dietary requirements please contact someone from the committee.
